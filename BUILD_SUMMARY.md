- ✅ CORS enabled for React frontend communication
- ✅ Development and production configurations

### Frontend (React)
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI with gradient header
- ✅ File upload component with drag-and-drop support
- ✅ Two-panel review interface (image + data)
- ✅ Fully editable vendor name field
- ✅ Dynamic editable grid for items (quantity, name, item #, price)
- ✅ Add/Delete item functionality
- ✅ Export to CSV feature
- ✅ Copy to clipboard feature
- ✅ "New Receipt" button to reset

### Additional Features

## Technology Stack (As Per PRD)

### Frontend
- ✅ React (via create-react-app)
- ✅ Axios for HTTP requests
- ✅ Modern CSS (custom styling, no UI library needed)

### Backend
- ✅ Python 3
- ✅ Flask web framework
- ✅ Flask-CORS for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Google Cloud Vision API integration (optional)
- ✅ Requests library for API calls

### Deployment Ready
- ✅ Gunicorn for production WSGI server
- ✅ Procfile for Heroku deployment
- ✅ Production build scripts
- ✅ Environment variable configuration

## Features Implemented (PRD Checklist)

### Core Features
- ✅ Anonymous receipt capture (no login required)
- ✅ Automated itemization and data extraction
- ✅ OCR service integration (Google Vision API)
- ✅ Vendor name extraction
- ✅ Line item extraction (quantity, name, item number, price)
- ✅ Review & edit interface
- ✅ Two-panel UI (image + data)
- ✅ Editable vendor name field
- ✅ Editable item list with distinct fields
- ✅ Add/delete row functionality
- ✅ Data export (CSV + clipboard)

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Monolithic web application
- ✅ React frontend
- ✅ Flask backend with REST API
- ✅ No database (session-based data)
- ✅ File upload support for images
- ✅ JSON API communication

## Current Status

### ✅ RUNNING
Both servers are currently active:
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5000
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000

### ✅ TESTED
- Backend API responds correctly to POST requests
- Frontend compiles and runs successfully
- File upload mechanism works
- Mock data functionality verified

## How to Use

1. **Access the app**: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. **Upload a receipt**: Click "Choose Receipt Image" and select a photo
3. **Process**: Click "Process Receipt" to extract data
4. **Review**: View the receipt image and extracted data side-by-side
5. **Edit**: Modify any vendor name, quantity, item name, number, or price
6. **Manage items**: Add new items or delete existing ones
7. **Export**: Save as CSV or copy to clipboard
8. **Reset**: Click "New Receipt" to process another receipt

## Optional: Enable Real OCR

Currently using mock data. To enable real Google Cloud Vision OCR:

1. Get API key from Google Cloud Console
2. Create `.env` file:
   ```
   GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
3. Restart Flask server

## Deployment Options (Future)

The app is ready to deploy to:
- **Backend**: Heroku, Railway, Render, Google Cloud Run
- **Frontend**: Vercel, Netlify, or serve from Flask in production
- **Full Stack**: Single Heroku dyno serving React build from Flask

## Next Steps

1. Test with real receipt images
2. Configure Google Cloud Vision API
3. Fine-tune the OCR parsing logic
4. Add more export formats if needed
5. Deploy to production when ready
