Product Requirements Document: Receipt Itemizer Prototype (V1)

1. Introduction & Vision

This document outlines the requirements for a web-based prototype whose primary function is to automatically itemize a receipt from a user-provided image. The user will upload a photo of a receipt, and the application will process it to extract the vendor's name and a digital list of each individual item, including its quantity, name, any associated item number, and price.

The core goal of this V1 prototype is to build and test the end-to-end functionality quickly, with a focus on the accuracy and detail of the data extraction. This will validate the technical feasibility before committing to a full-scale application. For speed, this version will be a public-facing tool and will not require any user account or login.

2. Target Audience & User Problems

Target User: Individuals who want a detailed and effortless way to digitize their receipts and track their purchases at an item level.
Problem: Manually typing every single item, code, and price from a receipt into a budgeting app is extremely tedious and error-prone. Users want a "fire-and-forget" solution where they can simply take a photo and have all the important data captured for them.
3. User Stories

As a user, I want to:

Visit a webpage and immediately be able to upload a photo of my receipt.
Have the app automatically scan the receipt to identify the name of the store/vendor.
Have the app generate a digital list of every item, showing the quantity, item name/description, item number (if present), and price.
Review the extracted vendor name and the itemized list alongside the receipt image to verify accuracy.
Easily edit or correct the vendor name, or any quantity, name, or price on the list.
Save or export the final, accurate itemized list.
4. Key Features for V1 (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)

The MVP will focus on the single, end-to-end flow of capturing and itemizing a receipt without user accounts.

Anonymous Receipt Capture: A simple, clear user interface to upload an image file from the user's device.
Automated Itemization & Data Extraction (Core Feature):
Upon image upload, the app sends the image to the backend.
The backend processes the image using an external Optical Character Recognition (OCR) service.
The backend parsing logic will specifically identify and extract:
The Vendor Name (e.g., "BLEACHER BAR", "Costco Wholesale").
Line items, structured to include Quantity, Item Name, Item Number/Code, and Price.
Review & Edit Interface:
A two-panel UI displaying the original receipt image next to the extracted data.
A dedicated field to display and edit the detected Vendor Name.
An editable list where each row represents an item and has distinct, editable fields for Quantity, Name, Item Number, and Price.
Functionality to add or delete rows in the item list.
Data Export: A simple "Export to CSV" or "Copy to Clipboard" button to allow the user to save their corrected data. (This replaces database storage for the no-login prototype).
5. Detailed Architecture & Technical Specification

Overall Architecture: A monolithic web application with a React frontend communicating with a Python/Flask backend via a REST API.

Frontend (User Interface)

Technology: React
Why: React's component-based structure is perfect for the dynamic review interface. Creating an editable grid or list of items where each cell is an input field is straightforward.
Key Libraries:
create-react-app: For rapid project setup.
axios: For uploading the image to the Flask backend.
UI Component Library (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design): To quickly build a professional-looking layout with file uploaders, buttons, and text fields.
Backend (Server-Side Logic)

Technology: Python with Flask
Why: Flask is ideal for creating a simple API to orchestrate the process. Python's data handling capabilities are excellent for parsing the JSON response from the OCR service and structuring it for the frontend.
Core Logic:
Create an API endpoint (e.g., /api/process-receipt) that accepts an image file.
Send the image to the chosen OCR service API.
Receive the structured JSON response from the OCR service.
Parse this response to specifically find the vendor name field and the line item fields (which often include quantity, description, and price).
Format this data into a clean JSON object to send back to the React frontend.
OCR Service (Critical Component)

Recommendation 1: Amazon Textract
Why: Highly recommended. Its AnalyzeExpense API is pre-trained on receipts and is explicitly designed to find the Vendor Name and return structured LineItemFields which include item, quantity, and price. This greatly simplifies the backend parsing logic.
Recommendation 2: Microsoft Azure Form Recognizer
Why: An excellent alternative. The pre-built prebuilt-receipt model also automatically identifies the MerchantName and structured Items array, which contains fields for Quantity, Description, and TotalPrice.
Recommendation 3: Google Cloud Vision AI
Why: A powerful, general-purpose OCR. While very accurate, it typically returns a raw dump of text with coordinates. You would need to write more complex Python code to manually locate the vendor name at the top and then parse each line to differentiate quantities, descriptions, and prices based on their patterns and positions.
Database & Deployment

Database: No database needed for V1. Since there are no user accounts, the data will only exist for the duration of the user's session and can be exported directly.
Deployment:
Frontend (React): Vercel or Netlify.
Backend (Flask): Heroku. These platforms are ideal for quickly deploying prototype applications and have robust free tiers.
