Product Requirements Document: Receipt Tracking App (V1)
1. Introduction & Vision

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile application designed to help users track their spending by scanning receipts. The primary goal for the initial version (V1) is to create a functional prototype as quickly as possible to validate the core concept. To achieve this, the initial focus will be on allowing users to upload images of receipts and manually input spending data. This approach simplifies the initial build by deferring the complexity of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) implementation. The long-term vision is to develop a comprehensive expense management tool with automated data extraction, categorization, and insightful spending analysis.

2. Target Audience & User Problems

Target User: Individuals who want a simple way to monitor their day-to-day spending and understand where their money is going. They are comfortable using mobile apps but may not be expert users.
Problem: Manually tracking expenses is tedious and often inaccurate. Users need a convenient way to capture spending at the point of purchase and categorize it for later review.
3. User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to:

Create an account or log in to the application.
Upload an image of a receipt from my phone's photo library or take a new photo.
Manually enter the total amount, vendor name, and date from the receipt.
Assign the expense to a category (e.g., "Groceries," "Dining," "Transport").
View a list of all my logged expenses.
See a simple summary of my spending by category.
4. Key Features for V1 (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)

The MVP will focus on the essential features needed to test the core functionality.

User Authentication: Simple email/password login and registration.
Image Upload:
Ability to select an existing photo from the phone's gallery.
Ability to use the phone's camera to take a new photo of a receipt.
Manual Data Entry Form: After uploading an image, the user will be presented with a form to input:
Vendor/Store Name (Text input)
Total Amount (Numerical input)
Date of Purchase (Date picker)
Category (Dropdown menu with predefined options)
Expense List View: A chronological list of all entered expenses, showing the vendor, total amount, and date for each entry.
Basic Spending Summary: A simple dashboard that displays total spending for each category over a selected time period (e.g., current month).
5. Architectural & Technical Recommendations

Given the goal of rapid prototyping, a web-based approach is highly recommended. This allows for faster development and testing on any device with a web browser, including an iPhone, without the complexities of native app development and app store approvals.

Option 1: The "Fastest to Prototype" Web-Based Approach
This architecture is optimized for speed and simplicity, making it ideal for a first version.

Architecture: Monolithic Web Application
Frontend (User Interface):
Recommendation: React or Vue.js.
Why: These are popular JavaScript frameworks with extensive documentation and a large community. They allow for the creation of a responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) that feels like a native app on mobile browsers. Both have a rich ecosystem of libraries for handling things like image uploads and forms.
Backend (Server-Side Logic):
Recommendation: Python with Flask or Node.js with Express.
Python with Flask: Flask is a minimalist "micro-framework" that is easy to learn and perfect for small to medium-sized applications. It allows you to get a server up and running with very little boilerplate code.
Node.js with Express: If you are already comfortable with JavaScript, using Node.js for the backend allows you to use the same language for both the frontend and backend, which can streamline development.
Database:
Recommendation: SQLite or PostgreSQL.
SQLite: This is a serverless, file-based database that is built into Python. It requires no setup and is the fastest way to get a database working for a prototype.
PostgreSQL: A more robust, open-source relational database that can scale with your application if you decide to move beyond the prototype phase. Many hosting providers offer managed PostgreSQL databases, making it easy to deploy.
Deployment:
Recommendation: Heroku or Vercel.
Why: These platforms (Platform-as-a-Service) are designed for easy deployment of web applications. You can connect your code repository (like GitHub), and they will handle the building and hosting of your application, often with a generous free tier for small projects.
