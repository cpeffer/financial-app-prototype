# Receipt Parsing Improvements - Summary

## Problem
The initial implementation used basic regex that couldn't properly extract items from real receipts. It would:
- Include subtotals, tax lines, and footer text as "items"
- Not properly detect quantities
- Not extract item numbers
- Include prices in item names
- Miss vendor names

## Solution
Complete rewrite of the `parse_receipt_text()` function with sophisticated parsing logic.

## Latest Update (Post-Testing with Real Receipts)

### Restaurant Receipt Format Support
The parser now handles **restaurant-style receipts** where items and prices are on separate lines:
- ✅ Detects "Quantity + Item Name" on one line, price on next line
- ✅ Improved vendor detection (skips "Card Here", "Fenway", etc.)
- ✅ Handles all 3 common formats:
  1. `2 ITEM NAME $12.99` (all on one line)
  2. `2 ITEM NAME` + `12.99` (separate lines) **← NEW!**
  3. `ITEM NAME 12.99` (no quantity shown)

### Verified Working
Tested with real Bleacher Bar receipt:
- ✅ Correctly identified "BLEACHER BAR" as vendor
- ✅ Extracted all 14 items with quantities and prices
- ✅ Filtered out subtotals, tax, gratuity, footer text
- ✅ Total matched: $255.00

## What Changed

### 1. Enhanced app.py
- ✅ Added `python-dotenv` support for automatic .env loading
- ✅ Completely rewrote `parse_receipt_text()` with 150+ lines of smart parsing
- ✅ Added comprehensive skip keywords (subtotal, tax, payment, etc.)
- ✅ Multiple price pattern matching (handles $12.99, 12.99, 12,99, etc.)
- ✅ Quantity detection from line start
- ✅ Item number extraction (multiple formats: #123, SKU:456, etc.)
- ✅ Name cleaning (removes prices, numbers, extra whitespace)
- ✅ Validation and filtering of invalid entries

### 2. New Testing Tools

**test_receipt.py** - Test individual receipts
- Processes a single receipt image
- Shows OCR extracted text
- Shows parsed results in formatted table
- Saves results to JSON for inspection
- Usage: `python test_receipt.py examples/receipt_1.jpeg`

**batch_test.py** - Test all receipts at once
- Processes all images in examples/ folder
- Shows summary of each receipt
- Saves comprehensive results to JSON
- Usage: `python batch_test.py`

## How to Use

### Step 1: Set Up API Key
```bash
# Get your API key from Google Cloud Console
# See GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md for instructions

# Create .env file
echo "GOOGLE_VISION_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

### Step 2: Test Your Receipts
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Test a single receipt
python test_receipt.py examples/receipt_1.jpeg

# Or test all receipts
python batch_test.py
```

### Step 3: Review Results
- Check the console output for parsed items
- Review the JSON files created
- Verify vendor names and item details are correct

### Step 4: Run the Web App
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

Then upload your receipts at http://localhost:3000

## Parsing Features

### Detects and Skips
- Subtotals, totals, tax lines
- Payment information (cash, credit, card numbers)
- Footer text (thank you, address, phone)
- Headers (receipt #, date, time)
- Empty lines and invalid entries

### Extracts
- **Vendor**: Store name from top of receipt
- **Quantity**: Numbers at start of line (e.g., "2 APPLES")
- **Item Name**: Description, cleaned of prices and codes
- **Item Number**: Supports #123, SKU:456, (789), 012345, etc.
- **Price**: Last price on line (handles multiple formats)

### Validates
- Item names must be > 2 characters
- Skips lines with only numbers/special chars
- Quantities must be reasonable (<100)
- Prices must be valid decimal format

## Example Output

### Input (OCR Text)
```
WHOLE FOODS MARKET
123 Main Street

2 ORGANIC BANANAS               $1.98
GREEK YOGURT SKU:789            $5.99
SOURDOUGH BREAD                 $4.50

SUBTOTAL                       $12.47
TAX                             $0.87
TOTAL                          $13.34
```

### Output (Parsed)
```
Vendor: WHOLE FOODS MARKET

Items:
1. Qty: 2 | ORGANIC BANANAS        | #     | $1.98
2. Qty: 1 | GREEK YOGURT           | #789  | $5.99
3. Qty: 1 | SOURDOUGH BREAD        | #     | $4.50
```

## Files Modified
- `app.py` - Enhanced parsing logic
- `requirements.txt` - Added python-dotenv

## Files Created
- `test_receipt.py` - Single receipt testing tool
- `batch_test.py` - Batch receipt testing tool
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md` - API setup guide
- `PARSING_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Technical details
- `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Next Steps

1. **Set up your Google Cloud Vision API key** (see GOOGLE_CLOUD_SETUP.md)
2. **Test with your receipts**: `python batch_test.py`
3. **Review the results**: Check if items are extracted correctly
4. **Fine-tune if needed**: Adjust patterns in `app.py` for your specific receipt formats
5. **Use the web app**: Process receipts with the improved UI

## Still Not Working?

If items still aren't being detected correctly:

1. Run `test_receipt.py` on the problematic receipt
2. Check the raw OCR text - is Vision API extracting the text correctly?
3. Look at the patterns in your receipt - do they match the supported formats?
4. Open an issue or modify `app.py` to add your specific patterns
5. Remember: you can always manually edit items in the web UI!

## Key Benefits

✅ **More Accurate**: Filters out non-item lines (subtotals, tax, etc.)
✅ **More Data**: Extracts quantities and item numbers
✅ **Cleaner Names**: Removes prices and codes from item descriptions
✅ **Better Testing**: Test scripts show exactly what's being extracted
✅ **Easy Setup**: .env file support, comprehensive documentation
✅ **Customizable**: Easy to add new patterns for your receipt formats

**The receipt itemizer is now ready to handle real-world receipts with much better accuracy!**
