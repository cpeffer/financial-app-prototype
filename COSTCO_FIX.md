# Costco Receipt Format Fix

## The Problem

When you ran `batch_test.py`, the Costco receipts showed incorrect quantities:
```
❌ 1532586x CLIFBARS26CT    $7.49   (Wrong! That's the item number, not quantity)
❌ 1795394x IZZE VARIETY    $17.99
❌ 963857x COORS LGT 36     $2.40
```

## Root Cause

Costco receipts have a unique format:
```
ITEMNUMBER ITEMNAME PRICE
1532586 CLIFBARS26CT 7.49
```

The parser was treating the 7-digit item number as a quantity because it appeared at the start of the line.

## The Fix

Added intelligence to distinguish between quantities and item numbers based on length:
- **5+ digits** = Item Number (set quantity to 1)
- **1-4 digits** = Quantity (normal behavior)

## Results After Fix

### Before
```
Qty: 1532586 | CLIFBARS26CT | Item#:       | $7.49  ❌
```

### After
```
Qty: 1       | CLIFBARS26CT | Item#:1532586 | $7.49  ✅
```
