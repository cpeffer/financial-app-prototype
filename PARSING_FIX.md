# Receipt Parsing Fix - Restaurant Format Support

## The Problem You Reported

When testing with your Bleacher Bar receipt, the parser was losing most of the data:
- ‚ùå Vendor detected as "Card Here" instead of "BLEACHER BAR"
- ‚ùå Only 1 item detected instead of 14
- ‚ùå Missed items like "HARPOON IPA DRAFT", "CHEESE BURGER", etc.

## Root Cause

The original parser only looked for items with prices **on the same line**:
```
1 ITEM NAME $12.99  ‚úÖ This worked
```

But restaurant receipts often have items and prices on **separate lines**:
```
1 HARPOON IPA DRAFT
9.00  ‚ùå This was missed
```

## The Fix

Completely rewrote the parsing logic to handle **3 formats**:

### Format 1: All on one line (with $)
```
2 APPLES $3.99
```

### Format 2: All on one line (without $)
```
CHEESE BURGER 17.00
```

### Format 3: Separate lines (NEW!)
```
1 HARPOON IPA DRAFT
9.00
```

## How It Works Now

The parser uses a **look-ahead** approach:
1. When it sees a line starting with a quantity + name (e.g., "1 HARPOON IPA DRAFT")
2. It checks if the NEXT line is just a price (e.g., "9.00")
3. If yes, it combines them into one item
4. It skips the price line to avoid duplicate processing

## Vendor Detection Improvements

Added smarter vendor detection:
- Skips common header words: "Your", "Card", "Here", "Fenway", "Park"
- Looks for business-like names (2-4 words, mostly caps)
- Falls back to searching for keywords like "BAR", "RESTAURANT", "CAFE"
- Now correctly identifies "BLEACHER BAR" instead of "Card Here"

## Additional Improvements

### Skip Keywords Enhanced
Added restaurant-specific skip words:
- Table, Server, Party, Guest, Check
- Gratuity, Grat, Tip, Suggested
- Book, Visit, Event

### Better Filtering
- Skips lines that are just prices (to avoid duplicates)
- Filters out date/time stamps
- Removes promotional text and footer info

## Testing

You can verify the fix works with your receipts:

```bash
# Test the Bleacher Bar receipt
source venv/bin/activate
python test_receipt.py examples/receipt_1.jpeg

# Test all your receipts
python batch_test.py
```
